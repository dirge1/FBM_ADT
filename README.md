This is the source code of the paper "Reliability modeling and statistical analysis of accelerated degradation testing with memory effects and unit-to-unit variability"

Paper link: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0307904X24005419

The folder "code_simulation" contains the source code of the simulation study.

In the folder, main_sim_FBM_utuv.m is the proposed model M0; main_sim_FBM is the model M1; main_sim_BM_utuv.m is the model M2; main_sim_BM is the model M3.

**Attention!**

We have identified an error in the figures 8, 10 and 11 in our article, which is related to the illustration of the deterministic trend of the degradation prediction. This error affected only the figure representation. The numerical results and conclusions of the study remain accurate.

We sincerely apologize for this oversight. The corrected figure is provided in the file "corrected_figures.PDF" for reference.
